Water temperature of the pond and water in the fish bag must be equalized. This can be accomplished by floating the bag of fish in your pond for 15 minutes (bag must be in the shade). After this time, remove and discard one cup of water from the bag and replace it with one cup of pond water. Repeat this process three more times at five minute intervals. You can then release the fish into the pond, however you should not dump the water from the bag into your pond.\n\nIn addition, if you are not sure the dealer where you purchased your fish employs preventive steps to insure healthy fish, you may want to do a salt dip for 15 seconds using 1 pound of pond salt per gallon of water in a separate container prior to releasing the fish. Do not use iodized salt."

Please be aware that some dripping is perfectly normal as it does take a few minutes for the cork to reseal after the needle has been extracted. A few drops is nothing to be worried about, but it keeps leaking from the needle hole hours later then please review this list of other possible scenarios:\n- Ensure you're accessing wines with natural cork. While you can access wines that use -synthetic closures those closures don't reseal and there'll be leakage.\n- Sometimes, wine can pool underneath the foil and appear to be dripping or leaking - again, to determine if this is the issue, you can remove the foil to check. This happens most frequently on a first access.\n- Temperature affects how a wine reseals. Corks at cooler temperatures take longer to reseal.\n- How long did you leave your Coravin in the cork? We don't recommend leaving the needle engaged in the cork for long periods of time, as it can make it more difficult for the cork to reseal.\n- Sometimes a cork in poor condition (either due to age, manufacturing, or storage) will have difficulty resealing in general.\n\nHopefully these tips will help and you might find this video helpful as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m75eTiVsLHg"

      "content": "Nothing beats the taste of fish & shellfish fresh out of the water. If you're lucky enough to catch fish yourself and enjoy cooking and eating your catch, or if you live near fishing communities and can buy seafood fresh off the boat, then you know what we're talking about. A few days after fish is caught and filleted, it begins to lose its freshness, bacteria start to do their work, and flavor gradually changes. After 2 weeks, virtually all \"fresh\" unfrozen fish will no longer be fit to eat. Luckily, fish that is flash-frozen stops the breakdown process. You can then keep this fish in a very fresh state for months, thawing and cooking it when you want to enjoy fish the way it tastes when it comes out of the water. The \"fresh\" fish that you see in the big-box discount grocery store in your neighborhood is usually either already a week or more old, or previously frozen. The exceptions to this are the natural/high-end grocers and fish markets who carefully source their fish. This is where we come in. We're in the sourcing and processing business - many of those natural/high end retailers are our customers - and in order to offer you a variety of the best fish in a state of freshest flavor, our fish is frozen as soon as possible after processing. In this case, the fish industry's inside quote rings true: Our frozen fish is usually fresher than fresh! It's what we feed our families, and we believe it's what you'll want to eat once you've tried it."

      "content": "At McConnell's, we have one goal: to make the finest ice creams! We achieve this by having exceptionally high standards across the board. To maintain these standards, it's critical that every ingredient in our ice creams be of the highest\nquality. While we're ardent supporters of organics in general, in our almost 70 years as a dairy, it's been our experience that milk & cream can vary greatly in quality and consistency. Inconsistency in milk & cream can be traced to any number of factors, including animal husbandry, pasture type and processing. The milk & cream we use comes from cows raised by local dairy co-ops on the Central\nCoast. It's grass-grazed, hormone and antibiotic free, and of exceptionally high quality. It's important to know that organic is a term that defines a process, rather than objective quality. There's wonderful and not-so-wonderful organic milk in the market, just as there's wonderful and not-so-wonderful organic fruit, nuts, chocolate, etc. \n\nWhile organic is certainly an important factor when it comes to selecting ingredients for McConnell's Fine Ice Creams, committing wholly to organics - over objective quality - would mean McConnell's valued a specific process over making the finest product we can make and this is unacceptable to us. I hope this informaiton was helpful!"

The stainless steel band may contain a small amount of nickel, but testing has shown that the amount is below the safety thresholds set by international regulating bodies. If you have concerns about nickel sensitivity, we have the following bands in nylon or vegan leather. You can check out all available accessories here: https://embr.attn.tv/sl/es28OMRk\n \nThe Wave 1 uses a standard 22mm watch pin, and the Wave 2 uses an 18mm watch pin, so they're both compatible with most styles of watch bands if you'd like to purchase something on your own.\n \nThe back of the Wave 2 is made of medical-grade polycarbonate (polycarbonate is a type of plastic that's known for being particularly strong). This part of the Wave is made of plastic to help insulate the skin from the metal heat sink, while still being comfortable against the skin. In the Wave 2, the plastic backing is built to be tougher than ever: it's thicker, more durable, and fully integrated into the round design without any protruding edges."

Running on a 220-volt outlet, a Level 2 charger can deliver between 12 and 80 miles of charge per hour - meaning you can generally get a full charge overnight. Level 3 chargers, or DC fast chargers, are used to get a rapid charge when you're taking a trip. They can deliver a charge rate of 3 to 20 miles per minute or more, and can fill most EVs in less than an hour."

Once the food has been released from the surface, you can clean with mild dish soap, and a non-abrasive sponge, then dry immediately.\n\nYou can watch our video here: youtube.com/watch?v=3UWAiW6SaoU&feature=youtu.be"

The difference between the different grades of matcha is the quality of the leaves used to make them. Younger tea leaves at the top of plants that are picked earlier in harvest are the most prized leaves for matcha.\n\nBecause they are younger, they contain less stems and veins. This makes them ideal for grinding into a very fine powder, and gives the matcha a sweeter and more delicate flavor. These are the leaves that are used in our highest grade of matcha, Ceremonial Matcha.\n\nAs you move down the body of the plant the leaves are bigger and more mature. Leaves that are more mature will have more stems and veins, making the matcha less fine. Tencha leaves are deveined by hand in the process of making matcha. Because the more mature leaves are more veiny, it is harder to separate every single stem and vein from the leaf. This can make the matcha more coarse.\n\nThe best of these leaves are used to make our Ceremonial and Premium Matcha, and the leaves not chosen are used to make our Culinary Matcha."

Its soft, velvety feel lends each style an instantly classic look while keeping the foot comfortable. Suede is typically more loose and pliable (uppers won't stand up on their own).\n\nA favorite for its distinct heritage look, oiled leather is treated with oil and wax for a two-toned effect. Crafted so no two pairs are exactly alike, this leather is designed to age beautifully with wear. Oiled Leather is typically stiffer and requires a more calculated break-in process to allow the leather to stretch."

Light to moderate raindrops or splashes from a wet road will not harm your ebike, but be weary of harsher weather and rainfall conditions. Level tires are not intended for riding in snow or during snow fall.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is, if weather impacts your visibility and has the possibility to affect your bike's functionality, it is likely not a safe riding condition."

If it feels like it's too much, it probably is. Don't push yourself too hard and keep the intensity at a manageable level. Remember, your body needs to recover after fasting, so it may take a few days for you to get back to the level you were at before the fast."

Because the sleeping pad is not attached to a rigid base, you may not see the same type of fit that you might see with a traditional travel crib. With Newton, every component has been designed and constructed to be as breathable as possible. From the sheet, through the sleeping pad and cover, all the way to the side walls of the travel crib itself - all of these fabrics are fully breathe-thru. This means that if there is an unintended bump in the fabric, you can rest easy knowing that there is no safety concern with the fully breathable mattress in the Newton Travel Crib."

As a result, our team recommends using room temperature or cool water to make the body wash and facial cleanser. Our concentrate is formulated to dissolve in any temperature of water with just a few shakes."

Also, many cities provide bulk recycling pick-up, as long as your bulky items are wrapped in a plastic furniture bag. All New York City customers can leave their old mattresses out on the curb with the rest of their recycling and the city will take care of it. If you are located elsewhere, we suggest calling your local authorities to see if they have a similar program in place.\n\nIf neither of those options are viable, 1-800-GOT-JUNK? can do the leg work. While this option isn't free, they will pick up the mattress (and box spring if you're also parting with that), do everything they can to get the mattress repurposed, or otherwise dispose of it safely."

Do you prefer a comforter with a thinner profile to cuddle you up but not too full? The Bamboo comforter is like a super soft quilt and it's perfect for those who want something that is never going to get too hot."

The gel and copper infusions only intensify the underlying benefits of the memory foam.\n\nThe one drawback of almost any memory foam infused mattress topper is a chemical smell upon opening. However, this smell is not harmful since ours are made from CertiPUR-US certified foam, which is tested to be free of harmful toxins and materials. The smell will quickly dissipate as the mattress topper airs out."

The slow growth of the beans allows them to absorb more nutrients and become much more dense and harder than grow coffee at lower elevations.

      "content": "Two saw-tooth hangers will be evenly spaced on the back of the canvas frame when the side they are applied to is longer than 36\". Smaller canvases have saw-tooth hangers installed in the center of the back of the frame. You may choose to add your own hardware if you have a preference for how to hang your artwork. When hanging art, the general rule of thumb is to have the center of the piece at the average persons eye-level. Galleries will often hang the center of the art from 60\" - 66\". If your canvas will hang over a piece of furniture just take that into consideration when hanging."
