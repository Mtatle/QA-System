If you're taking a shorter trip or are a light packer, a 26\" case may be sufficient. However, if you plan to pack more or are going on a longer trip, a 29\" case may be better suited for your needs. It's also important to consider your mode of transportation and any weight restrictions that may apply. Additionally, some people may find a larger case more cumbersome to handle, so that's something to consider as well. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what you feel will work best for your specific travel needs."

      "shortcut": "",
      "content": "Good question! With so many options, it can be tough to choose. Here's some information about the key differences.\n\nSerums are concentrated moisturizers that are lighter weight than creams or lotions, and their active ingredients are generally more potent. They target a variety of skin concerns (like hyperpigmentation and dark spots) by delivering a large dose of key ingredients. Some serums can be used alone, but most OLAY serums are designed to be worn under another moisturizer. Find out more about our range of OLAY Serums. \n\nLotions have a medium consistency. Many people prefer them for daytime use since they're easily absorbed into the skin. You can use them alone or over a serum. They tend to be good for oily or combination skin. \n\nCreams, the most common type of moisturizer, are richer and thicker than lotions and serums. They easily penetrate skin to deliver key ingredients that lock in moisture. By binding water to the skin and reducing evaporation, creams actually increase skin's water content. Not all cream moisturizers are the same, so it's important to choose based on your skin type. Check out OLAY Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Vitamin C Lightweight Moisturizer, and Retinol 24 Night Moisturizer, a few of our most popular creams.\n\nOLAY Whips are one of our more recent breakthroughs in skin care science, delivering powerful results with a light-as-air finish. Whips are uniquely formulated with Active Rush Technologyâ¢ to hold and quickly release 1000x their weight in hydration and active ingredients. Whips transform from cream to liquid on contact, flash absorbing into skin and leaving a smooth, matte finish. They're available with and without SPF in our Regenerist line."

If you use them in a closet or garage where there is more airflow, they will last about 30 days. Pouches unused, sealed in the silver bag, will last for months and months since the bag is air tight.

Less officially, it never hurts to burn some sage to promote bag healing. Following that, we recommend using simple green (or other mild solvent) on the affected areas, then give the bag a warm and soapy bath in dawn or a similar dish-washing liquid.

Some dogs, especially those who were abused or are guarded eaters, will tend to swallow their food and treats without proper chewing. This can present a choking hazard if too large of a bully stick is swallowed. Remember to use caution with any new dog chew and spend time understanding your dog's behavior and reaction to them."

For example, within the container waxes we have, some are extremely soft and require only one pour, but there are some that are harder and require a second pour. Within the pillar waxes, you can choose a wax with a more consistent color throughout or one that has a mottled effect.

In the case of vaginal dryness, it works to attract and retain moisture in the cells of the vaginal lining, which helps to create a healing environment for thinning and damaged skin. The hyaluronic molecules in it can absorb up to 1,000 times their own weight in water, which helps regain vaginal elasticity and softness. Additionally, hyaluronic acid has been rigorously studied in multiple clinical trials and is shown to be safe and free of side effects, with no effect on estrogen levels."

Both laser treatments are simple, fast, and effective for clinical-grade wrinkle reduction in as little as 90 days. They also feature 5 power levels (or comfort levels) that enable you to adjust each laser to compliment your skin sensitivity.\n\nWith a 10x larger treatment tip than NIRA Precision, the NIRA Pro Laser is able to treat the full face, neck, chest, and back of hands in just minutes a day. In addition, our in-house laser experts designed NIRA Pro without a treatment button - enabling treatment to automatically begin once the device tip is in full contact with the skin.

After all, it is an electric bike, with electrical components needing some added caution. Sinch is built to the IPX4 water-resistant standard. IPX4 is a standard that indicates your bike is resistant to multi-directional water splashes, meaning it is okay to ride or park your Sinch in rain. Light to moderate raindrops or splashes from a wet road will not harm your ebike, but be wary of harsher weather and rainfall conditions. Additionally, although Sinch can ride remarkably in snow, that isn't to say it is as safe to ride during active and heavy snowfall.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is, if weather impacts your visibility and has the possibility to affect your bike's functionality, it is likely not a safe riding condition."

This shear is a favorite for working with men's haircuts, especially scissor over comb work.\n\nThe InvisiBlend is anything other than a traditional blender. Its over-polished blunt blade forces the hair over the 23 sharp convex teeth in such a way that no two hairs are cut the same length.

Gently push the whole pellets to the side to uncover the pee volcano and then lift that wood shaving volcano shape up with your flexible spatula. You'll find you have a nice clean area, with very little fuss.\n\nIf your bun likes a softer surface, we have very soft aspen bedding that can be put on as a \"top dressing.\" It makes all this more affordable too.

Series 6 adds to AutoSense by giving SensoFlex, a 20 degree pivoting head to maintain better contact with skin making it more efficient. Series 7 continues to have AutoSense and builds on that with an even more flexible head called the 360 Flex, which pivots 20 degrees front to back and 10 degrees side to side. Series 8 moves AutoSense forward with increased power for an easier shave. Series 9 is our best shaver with its 4+1 pro head, utilizing AutoSense and providing the fastest and most comfortable shave we have to offer. Hope this helps!"

Firm and extra-firm control pieces are perfect for formal, structured clothing like wedding dresses, prom gowns, evening gowns, and cocktail dresses.\n\nHope this helps and please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with."

We invest more in working directly with every single supplier from seed to finished sheet. This means we personally know and regularly communicate with the farmers, the fiber producers, the yarn makers and weavers, treatment facilities, bag makers, label makers...and so on. This access is unprecedented in the bedding industry and it allows us to make unique and better products that will never pill, shred, discolor, or change feel when washed. It's premium-quality luxury bedding, acutely managed from start to finish. In addition, we personally ensure good working conditions and fair labor practices. Our fiber process recycles water and doesn't release waste into the environment. Additionally, we avoid the use of caustic chemicals unlike most brands. The result of all of this work is the softest and highest quality viscose from bamboo fabric, fiber, and silk made today."

Litter-Robot 4 features an enlarged waste drawer for even more waste capacity, which means emptying is required less often. Litter-Robot cycles 7 minutes after each use, but if the wait time is interrupted by another cat entering, the timer will reset for another 7 minutes, which could cause waste to be present in the litter for longer than 7 minutes.

No need to spend extra money on a roof rack. We've been told this can help you save on gas $$ too! Our kayaks also have 60% less plastic than traditional rotomolded kayaks on average. There's no need to lift it above your head on a roof rack or recruit friends to help you port it to the water. It's lightweight and easy to transport in a pack, you can walk, bike, or bus it to the water."

Tilt the paddle so one blade rests on the beach. Make sure to keep your weight over the paddle (it's ok to sit on the shaft as you enter the cockpit). Place your feet in the boat, then slide your legs in. Use the paddle as a stabilizing brace. Then bring the paddle in front of you and use both hands to push the boat into the water. With 1 hand, place the paddle blade-down into the sand and push. With the other hand, make a fist, push it onto the beach and drive the boat into the water. Use your hips to add extra forward thrust. Once it's clear of the beach, start paddling."

Try picking a DYEposit shade that will work with your natural hair color, so if you have light brown hair, try red or chocolate, and if you're a natural redhead, copper or red will look amazing!

Do not water again until the soil is completely dry. Err on the side of under-watering and keep an eye out for signs of rot. Adding rocks to the bottom of the pot will not increase drainage.

This also means that all of the beans are processed in the exact same way and roasted the same way. This keeps the other beans from mixing with others, which can affect the flavor of your coffee and introduce foreign things like mycotoxins that may be present in other coffee beans that could be blended in."

If you don't want to do that, you can also use the back of your thumbnail to scoop it and it will flake right up on your nail.

We recommend giving lower amounts if more than one daily product contains probiotics (Digestive Probiotics, Allergy Skin Health Food Topper, Allergy Support, Allergy Skin Health, and more) to ensure that your dog is getting a balanced amount. We also don't recommend combining our Advanced Hip + Joint and Hemp Mobility products because they contain some of the exact same active ingredients."

Our Clip-In Bun looks and feels real (because it is!) so it will blend naturally with your hair. Synthetic hair is generally stiff, coarse to the touch, shiny and moves differently from human hair which won't blend as well with your natural hair.\n\nWe went through multiple variations in the size of our Clip-In Buns before we landed on our finished product to ensure the bun isn't too large or overly bulky. We can say with full confidence that we designed the most natural-looking bun on the market!"

Then, paint in 2-3 thin coats while giving the coats at least 5-10 minutes of dry time in between. Seal with Super Glossy Top Coat and reapply every 2-3 days to really lock in the mani and keep it fresh! \n\nIf you're still experiencing chipping after following these steps, add in Nail Primer to your routine before painting to help further dehydrate your nail plate."

When we test mood changers in our lab, we use extremely hot water and extremely cold ice water to really see the change, this helps us make sure each \"mood\" is correct. This is why lukewarm water or your body temp may not show as much of a drastic change. While Sun Changers need a UV index of at least 4 in order for them to change. Please also note that if you are using the Gel Method, some brands of Gel liquids have \"UV blockers\" in their formula to prevent yellowing from the sun, this can also prevent the color change.\nIf you could follow up and provide a video of the manicure not changing that would be extremely helpful when we touch base with our Quality Control department to report your color complaint."

As soon as you lift your foot off the accelerator - and when you push down on the brake pedal - regenerative braking uses the electric motor to capture energy that would normally be dissipated as heat. In this situation, the electric motor actually works as a generator, and sends energy back to the battery - so it can be used to power the vehicle later. \n\nPlug-in hybrids, which have larger batteries than conventional hybrids, come with a charging cable. Depending on the model, some plug-in hybrids can drive somewhere between 25 and 60 miles on electric power alone, enough for many daily commutes. It's recommended that you recharge a plug-in hybrid overnight so that you can do as much of your driving as possible in electric mode."

For example, if your calculation came out to 1.42, you must round up and purchase 2 rolls of wallpaper to have enough material. Hope this helps!"

To do this, we recommend gently buffing the nail so that it has a gritty feel, not a totally smooth one and applying a coat of our non-acid bonding primer which strengthens the bonds between our gel base coat and the nail surface."

However, mattresses are large items, so you should exercise caution while lifting, positioning, and unwrapping your mattress. We recommend two adults complete the setup process. Here's how to unbox your Nolah mattress step by step:\n\n- Once the package arrives, bring it in and lay the box flat on the floor next to your bed frame or foundation. Open one end of the box, and pull out the mattress roll.\n- With the plastic still on, lift the mattress roll and place it on top of your bed frame or foundation. Line it up with your base so the mattress has ample space to unroll and expand.\n- Remove the outer layer of shrink wrap by hand. Before the next step, prepare for the mattress to unravel and expand quickly. Our mattresses are compressed for shipping, so they exert force as they unwrap.\n- Use scissors to carefully cut open the inner layer of plastic wrap. As soon as air enters the wrap, the mattress will start to expand and flatten. Once it lays flat, shift the mattress to align it with your foundation if necessary."
