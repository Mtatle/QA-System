These ribbons serve as a reminder to pilots to remove specific parts or components before take off. \n\nThese warnings are of extreme importance; in some cases, non-removal of a labeled part has caused airplane crashes. As our iconic flight jackets became popular with our civilian customers, the \"Remove Before Flight\" ribbon was implemented as a way to pay homage to our aviation roots."

Once the ottoman connector is tightened onto the top of the ottoman leg, you then bring the ottoman to the sofa at an angle (the part of the ottoman facing a bit downwards) so that when you straighten it out, the \"hook\" part of the connector latches onto the front rail of the sofa. You need to really reach under to connect and squeeze the ottoman and sofa rail very closely. Unfortunately I understand connecting it is a little difficult since the connector was made to be pretty tight. It's supposed to fit quite exactly to make sure that the connector stays on tight.  We also recently added a drawing to our instruction manual that might help: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0089/4487/7630/files/Sabai_InstructionManual_Ottoman_Connector-9-9-21.pdf?v=1631211833 If coming at an angle doesn't work we can send a new one, although it would be the same as the one you have. We're also having our designer look into this issue and he is currently in the process of making revisions/redesigning our ottoman connector. When we have this new revision we'd be happy to send it! Just please follow up with us in a month to see what the status is."

That's another reason why we offer all our customers an extended money-back window.

Also, it's best to not clean your delicate lenses with coarse materials (e.g., wool, paper towels, bath towels, t-shirts, etc.). Although they may seem soft, they can scratch your lenses. Lastly, do not lay your eye wear lens-down; this is one of the common ways that lenses end up scratched. They should be stowed away in their case whenever you are not wearing them."

The bag is then hung above the patient's head. IV therapy bags are designed to let gravity, as opposed to a syringe or other forced technique, carry fluid into the veins over time.\n\nThe duration of a single treatment varies from person to person, but typically lasts 30 - 45 minutes. The exceptions to this timeframe are our NAD IV treatments, which generally last 1 - 2 hours per session."

Our favorite bikini-washing formula is combining cold water with just a touch of gentle laundry detergent. Let it soak for 5-10 minutes then rinse it out gently and lay flat to dry. Even on white swimwear, stay away from bleach. For spot cleaning, a little bit of Shout will do the trick. \n\nIf you're drying your swimsuits outside, hang or lay them in the shade. Drying in the sun too long can cause discoloring and fading. Never iron or throw your suits in the dryer. Too much heat can cause fading as well or terrible damage to the fabric."

However since you remove the cork to use it, the Pivot also works on synthetic and composite corks bottles. Perfect for casual consumption. \n \nOur Timeless systems allow the preservation of bottles of wine for much longer. You can pour your favorite still wines without pulling the cork. You just need to place the Timeless System on top of the bottle and push the needle through the cork. Bottles sealed Natural Cork will last the natural shelf life of that Wine, up to months and years later. Hope this helps!"

Both are capable of engraving applications such as wood, glass, leather, and acrylic. The mid-range and high power however have better cutting capabilities. Fiber markers ,on the other hand, are designed for metal materials and hard plastics. Fiber markers are more powerful and engrave quicker than desktop and cabinet lasers by concentrating the laser beam into a thinner point."

This will help clean any urine that may have missed its mark, as both male and female dogs may pee too close to the side or splash. Make sure to get under the tray too! If it is the grass that is smelling, you can also try soaking it in the solutions above then rinse and dry completely. If soaking in bleach do not go over 5 minutes and make sure the ratio of water is greater than bleach. We also recommend using our very own Turftastic to eliminate all urine odor from the synthetic grass or live grass: https://porchpotty.com/products/turftastic-the-first-odor-eliminator-for-dog-potties?_pos=1&_psq=Turftastic&_ss=e&_v=1.0"

      "content": "With a long, tubular shape and blunt tip, a honing steel-also called sharpening steel or honing rod-is designed to realign the edge of your knife's blade with just a few strokes.\n\nHow is this process different from sharpening? The difference is, quite literally, microscopic: as you use your knife, the sharpened part of the blade-i.e. the edge-develops tiny (as in, too small to see with the naked eye) dents, dings, and other defects. With sharpening, you're literally creating a new edge by shaving away incredibly thin layers of metal; with honing, you're simply pushing the existing edge back into alignment, which can make your blade feel temporarily sharper. You can read more on the differences between honing and sharpening in our guide: https://madeincookware.com/blogs/honing-vs-sharpening"

It also comes in more color variances if you'd like something more vibrant or subtle!\n\nThe Level is our classic commuter bike. Though it's heavier than Soltera, it is designed to let you ride faster. If a higher top speed is of utmost importance to you, the Level can reach top speeds of 28 MPH on pedal assist. A rear rack and fenders are also included with the Level in the event you'll be needing these accessories!"

If you have Lume-X, Dive Mode can be accessed through Mission Control. If not, you can manually turn on Dive Mode: with the Lume Cube facing away from you, hold down both buttons until the red charging light blinks. To disable Dive Mode, tap the combination LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT and try cycling through brightness levels by tapping the left button. This can take a few tries to get the timing right.\n\nThis mode has been added fairly recently and has not been added to the guides as we have such a small percentage of customers that use these lights for diving below 60ft."

You can put rolled up terry cloth towels in the pockets to help absorb the moisture from the corners and speed drying. When washing a changing pad you'll need to ensure that all the water is removed before air drying. We suggest putting the washed changing pad on a dry towel and rolling it up tightly to squeeze out the excess water (repeat until all water is removed). We also recommend spot treatment before washing as that'll help loosen up the stains before a regular wash, sometimes even soaking the bag over night in one of these treatments. We've heard things on Motsenbocker Lift Off, Magic Eraser, Boogie Wipes, Shout Wipes, or a paste of Oxy Clean, Dawn dish soap, baking soda works great depending on what the marks are."

This provides natural analgesia in the body without the need to ingest medication or undergo manual manipulation or surgery.\n\nTENS therapy machines can help relieve pain associated with chronic and acute conditions such as headaches, migraines, neck pain, shoulder pain, back pain, sciatica, leg pain, lower limb pain, foot and ankle pain, poor circulation, fibromyalgia, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica, athletic or exercise injuries and more."

In 90% of cases similar to yours, the gas is either leaking or being wasted from one of several known places. The First could be that the capsule cup itself is leaking. We recommend cleaning the threads inside the capsule cup and where it attaches, as sticky residue can build up there, preventing a thorough seal. This can be done with a hot, wet cloth (preferably lint-free, like a bar towel). You also can use a toothbrush and hot water. Allow the threads to dry before reattaching.\n\nThe Second main thing to check on is the gas used per pour, as it's possible that excess gas is escaping after the pour. When pouring your glass of wine, please make sure to only press the trigger lightly 2-3 times to get the flow going. At the end of your pour, when you straighten your Coravin upright, if you hear a long hiss of gas escaping this is indicative of having used too much Argon.  \n\nOther tips to help, please do not unscrew the device to check on the capsule as this will waste all remaining Argon.  Also please remove the cork at the end of the bottle and simply pour wine as regular. Please let me know if any of these tips help solve your issue! If not we would be happy to continue troubleshooting what is wrong with your device, and even replace it if need be. We would also be happy to send you some extra capsules to replace those you lost to this issue."

Due to the limitations of the Pro device in treating such intricate areas, the Precision laser might be a more suitable option.\n\nThe NIRA Precision laser, designed for smaller and more delicate treatment areas, could be easier to maneuver and apply accurately on areas like the nasolabial folds, marionette lines, corners of the mouth, lipstick lines, and laugh lines. Its design allows for precise targeting, which is particularly important when dealing with sensitive or detailed regions."
