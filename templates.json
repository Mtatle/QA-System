Be sure to thoroughly rinse the metal bracelet with clear water and completely dry it before reinstalling it on your watch. If the bracelet cannot be removed easily from your watch and your model is classified as a 50-meter (or higher) water resistant model and has been properly maintained, you may wash the bracelet without removing it. If your timepiece is classified as less than 50-meter water resistant, or is not a water resistant model, we suggest you take your watch to your local jeweler or send it to the nearest Authorized Citizen Service Center for professional cleaning of the exterior."

Using a LED light, cure for 30 seconds, or use a UV light to cure for 1 minute. Using gel polish color of your choice, apply a thin layer from cuticle to free edge. Be sure to cap the tips of the nail to ensure complete coverage. Cure for 60 seconds with an LED light or 2 minutes with a UV Light. Perform steps 3-4 again for each nail, and each nail should have 2 layers of gel polish. Apply a thin layer of Tack Free Gel from cuticle to free edge, and remember to cap the tips. Cure for 60 seconds with a LED light or 2 minutes with a UV Light. Then, apply Cuticle oil to the skin surrounding the nail to have a complete, nourished, and calcium-enriched gel polish manicure."

Each morning after use, put your patch adhesive side down on the storage shield and keep the storage shield in a place away from dust. To cleanse the patch, rinse it with water and allow to completely dry before reapplying to skin or back onto the storage shield."

First, open the brush cap and remove the rubber band from around the bristles, then slide the sleeve back up over the bristles and put the cap back on. Next, bang the top of the brush on a hard surface, such as a tabletop 6-8 times. You'll want the brush sitting vertical (brush bristles facing down with the cap on) on the tabletop with the cap hitting the table. You'll want to use quite a bit of force when doing so (enough force to help release some of the air pressure in the brush's filter, so don't go easy on it). Once you perform this tapping method, remove the brush cap, slide back the sleeve and run your finger through the bristles so they bend and flick upwards. You should see a \"poof\" of powder. Once you see this, the brush is fully activated. If you don't see this, try repeating the steps by putting more force in it this time. The hard force is really the key in activating the brush as it allows for the powder to push through the filter."

If they work you can remove the backing and attach to the underside of the strap. If they are still too loose, then you would be able to return both the instep pads and sandals. Hope that helps!"

Another key difference is that the Commuter is equipped with tires whereas the Pace 500 model offers butyl rubber tubes. The level 2 is more equipped and offers better features compared to the Pace 500 model. I personally love the on-demand Throttle feature that it comes with, you can use this feature to throttle from a dead stop upto 20MPH! Hope this helps! :)"

We also highly recommend that you consult your child's physician before your child uses a weighted blanket. When used correctly, weighted blankets are considered safe for most children, as long as the blanket is an appropriate size and weight.\n\nWhen choosing or considering a weighted blanket for a child, it is generally best to look for one that is 10% of their body weight. For example, if your child weighs 100 pounds, a 10-pound weighted blanket would be most appropriate. Additionally, do not puncture the weighted insert. If the insert with glass beads becomes torn or damaged, dispose of it immediately as it might become a choking hazard."

Additionally, when comparing the same item on different monitors or at different angles on those monitors, they will appear to be different colors.

These results showed that eating a Fast Bar doesn't interfere with key physiological markers of fasting.  The study also showed that Fast Bar gave people a feeling of being fuller and curbed the desire to eat for up to 3 hours after consumption. In other words, you can eat a Fast Bar to help make fasting easier and more pleasant, and maintain similar ketone and blood glucose levels as a water-only fast."

Here are some of our best practice tips for needle use.\n\n- Ensure that your needle is as finger-tightened as possible before inserting it into the cork.\n- Be sure that the needle guide is sitting right on top of the cork.\n- While you're pouring, be sure to use both hands the entire time - one hand to hold the bottle, and the other to hold the handle of the Coravin. If you only hold the bottle but not the Coravin handle, the needle will not be supported and this may cause it to bend\n- During extraction, ensure that you're pulling the needle out perfectly straight (hold the clamps to the bottle with one hand and carefully pull up on the handle with the other)\n- Daily rinse the spout and needle under a stream of hot tap water, remove from the water, and do a quick press and release of the trigger to clean and maintain your Coravin\n- You'll know it's time to replace the needle when the black non-stick coating starts to wear off and the shiny steel of the needle becomes visible - after at least 300 uses\n\nThis video may help as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2vaEFqYdY"

The Oral-B DTC store does not ship to these states.\nAre you using a payment method that we accept in the store? \n\nIs the Billing Name and Address you entered on your order the same as it appears on your credit card statement? Sometimes even a minor difference will make the credit card company decline our pre-authorization and so we have to cancel the order. \n\nIs it possible the card has been reported as missing or stolen in recent days, or has it been turned off for new authorizations? Lately, some credit cards have a new feature that allows the consumer to turn off the card from new authorizations. If you think there may be the possibility anything like this might have happened, I would suggest calling your credit card company just to make sure they know you want to use the card and that they see it is in good standing. \n\nDo you have enough credit limit on your card to cover the order? If you are using a debit card for the order, you still need to have enough in the checking account tied to that card for the order to be approved. \n\nIf this doesn't help, we completely apologize and regret the loss, but you may purchase your brush heads through other retailers."

      "content": "We're sorry that you have had some issues with optimal performance from the Coravin Capsules. These tips and pointers may help.\n\n- When inserting the capsule, quickly tighten the capsule cup onto the Coravin unit until it's as tight as you can get it - there should be no more give to the cup. This should ensure that the seal is complete and the gas will not slowly leak over a short period of time. And don't \"untwist\" the cup until you're sure it's empty; otherwise all of the gas that is remaining will quickly release.\n- Another note - you want to be sure you only use enough gas for the pour that you want. If, when you finish your pour and bring the bottle back to an upright position, you hear a long release of gas then you may have used too much gas for the pour that you want and the gas just releases into the air and is wasted. At the end of your pour you should hear only a slight \"psst\" of gas if you hear anything at all.\n- Finally, if you're going to finish a bottle, we recommend you pull the cork to conserve argon gas. If you're going to pour the rest of the bottle of wine, don't pressurize with argon until the bottle is completely empty. The Coravin System is not meant to replace removing the cork entirely - if you're going to finish a bottle of wine then just pull the cork!\n\nYou may find this video helpful as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWNuENf0Gys"

Remember with a standard battery you can travel 30-60 miles on one charge, or with a long range battery, 50-90 miles. So there's plenty of time to charge your battery overnight if you're one of those people who is going to be riding every day! Rhinos are equipped with 15Ah or 21Ah high capacity Samsung Cell Lithium Removable batteries which are some of the most energy dense and reliable on the market and are designed to let you go further, more efficiently.\nThat said, typically with lithium technology (like in our batteries), you'll see a reduction of up to 15-20% of battery capacity after around 500 full charge cycles. The 500 charging cycles are additive, so charging your battery at 50% up to 100% means you're only consuming half of a charging cycle."

This two-week interval between aesthetic treatments is typically recommended to ensure the skin has ample time to recover from the prior major treatment.\n\nThe NIRA Laser generates heat beneath the skin to promote collagen, which could potentially lessen the effectiveness of toxins introduced to your skin, such as those used in Botox treatments. While there might be no specific study on this concern, it's wise to stay on the side of caution to ensure that you maximize the benefits of your treatments and avoid any potential setbacks."

The larger battery in a plug-in hybrid allows you to drive a significant distance on electric power alone. Indeed, they often have enough range to complete all of your daily commuting without having to use any gas if you plug in overnight. But, when you do want to take a longer trip, you still have the flexibility, range, and convenient refueling of a gasoline vehicle."

However, the final price will be determined by the specific item you get. We charge a $250 non-refundable consultation fee which is applied in full toward the cost of the piece if you decide to create your order. GLD receives hundreds of custom requests and this allows us to separate curious people from those that are intending to purchase a custom piece.\n \nUpon paying the consultation fee, you will be paired with a custom jewelry expert who will work with you to design your custom piece.\n \nWe work primarily with 10-24k solid gold (Yellow, White, and Rose Gold) and all classes of gems. We also can work with Rhodium, Sterling Silver, and Platinum. The time of the custom process varies from 2-8 weeks depending on the complexity of the design and the changes you require during design."

So yes, it's okay to wait until 6 months. That being said, if your baby is ready for solids between 4-6 months (check readiness with pediatrician), then 'what type foods' you offer can have an impact on brain development. This is because certain nutrients are preferentially utilized for brain development at this time. Nutrients like iron, vitamin A, zinc, copper and iodine."

Even though the athletes' androgen levels were clearly elevated, the T/E ratio remained within the acceptable range after 6 weeks of Tongkat Ali supplementation. Just to be safe, though, check the official documentation of your tournament or sports association."

For light spot cleaning using a simple baby wipe will sometimes do the trick! For heavier spot cleaning, we have found that using a damp cloth with a small amount of mild detergent, such as baby detergent, works great. First, stuff them with newspaper or paper towels, so the leather is tight. Then, you'll wipe the Piper Finns as much as needed, saturating them with the cleaning solution. It's best to let the shoes sit and dry (preferably in the sun, if you can). They might dry a little darker, but they will lighten up shortly after. You can then use the brush inside the cleaning kit to lightly brush and even out the leather after they completely dry. If you don't have a cleaning kit, something with soft bristles such as a toothbrush will also work."

Most messes won't go through to the core, allowing you to easily switch the cover during a late night change and get your little one back to sleep. It has the same breathe-thru materials on both sides making it easy to flip or switch as needed. When you're ready to add waterproof protection during toddler and potty training stages, the Crib Mattress Pad easily fits on it like a fitted sheet giving breathable, waterproof protection. The pad is also a great item to have when traveling or for a childcare setting. Our Waterproof mattress has an underlining of waterproofing on one side of the cover for toddler years and the same breathe-thru material of the Original on the infant side. The biggest risk for suffocation during child development is during the first 12 months. Though the waterproof side is still breathable, we want infants to have the most breathable, completely unhindered airflow sleeping environment possible for the first year, which is why we recommend waiting until year 1 to use the waterproof side, however, you know your child's development and mobility best. While we understand waterproofing seems most desirable to help with messes, the infant side of the cover is water-resistant and when babies leak or *explode* in the first year of life, these accidents are easily managed by washing the cover and most times even rinsing the core."

All our ingredients, whether natural or synthetic, are rigorously researched for safety within the context of a particular formulation and selected based on serving a necessary function, such as pigmentation, preservation, or performance. With our formulation strategy, we exclude 1,500+ controversial offenders that are known or suspected carcinogens, endocrine and hormone disruptors, allergens, and animal by-products. We know there are different brands throwing around different words to describe their products, so we encourage our customers to thoroughly read ingredient labels and make educated decisions for themselves; for our part, we promise to always do the leg-work to ensure our ingredient lists are safe and transparent."

Using either the app or the Wave's buttons, you can fine-tune your Wave to best fit your needs.\n \nWe made the new Wave more than 20% lighter with a more compact, ergonomic form factor. (It's so comfortable, you might even forget you're wearing it!) And even with a smaller ceramic plate, testers rated the cooling and warming sensations of Wave 2 as more powerful compared to Wave 1.\n \nWe understand that thermal comfort can be a very individual experience, and Embr Wave may not be the perfect solution for every person. For this reason, the best way to find out if Embr Wave will work for you is to try it out for yourself. \n\nWe have a 30-Day Satisfaction Guaranteed policy, so if it turns out Embr Wave isn't right for you, no problem. You can return it within 60 days for a full refund!"

However, these programs need to be funded. To fund them, each state established the state tire fees which help cover the cost of recycling. Installers and tire distributors pay these funds to ensure the unusable tires are correctly recycled and used.\n\nAs a result, Priority Tire, as other tire distributors, is required to charge state tire fees from our customers."

There are a few reasons as to why scannable tattoos likely won't scan on your skin. \n\n- Body Curvature: The human body does not have a lot of flat spots. Once applied to a curved surface, scanning a code can become more difficult. Additionally, skin is very flexible, which can have a big impact on if a code will scan or not. \n- Line Weight: The custom team often needs to increase the line weight of designs, which in the case of barcodes will make them unusable. \n- Smudging: Codes such as barcodes and QR codes often have thin or small white areas. These can easily be lost by the surrounding ink smudging and filling in the area. \n- Application Error: You may not have perfect application. All it takes is a small scratch or crease during application to make the code not usable."

      "content": "Suede leather is made from the underside of the animal hide, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture made of little fibers. The way these fibers are arranged can alter the material's appearance. For instance, when the nap is flattened, it causes more light to be reflected off the surface. This causes the area to look lighter. When the nap is raised, less light is reflected off the material. This causes the area to look darker. Even though the material is the same color, the angle and direction of the fibers cause these visual shifts, especially noticeable in dark colors like black or dark brown.\n\nThis is a normal characteristic for suede leather and can be resolved by brushing the suede using a suede brush or dry towel. This will help to restore the nap on your footwear and create the desired effect."

We would need the stitch file to give a specific answer. We can do some custom designs, and there'll be a one-time digitizing fee of $30 charged for the work-up of the logo. Future orders with the same logo don't get charged this fee. Our current lead time is about 2-3 weeks depending on where the items are located. If you'd like us to work up a quote, please email us at newsales@epicsports.com or give us a call at 888-269-2440. Here's the information the sales team will request; the image you want to get quoted, if your item has a color/size, please be specific. If you're a first time customer, you'll need to provide your shipping address, full name + organization name (if relevant) and phone number."
