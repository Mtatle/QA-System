Meaning, the lawn performs best when it's dry (we recommend watering it very little so that it stays thirsty). When your pup uses it, urine will absorb into the soil. Over time, as it fills up, it may start to seep through. That's where the tray comes in. After a couple of deliveries, you'll get to know how long it lasts with your dog.
