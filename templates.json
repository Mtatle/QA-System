To clean, first remove the metal bracelet from the watch, then use a soft brush and warm soapy water to clean the bracelet. Be sure to thoroughly rinse the metal bracelet with clear water and completely dry it before reinstalling it on your watch. If the bracelet cannot be removed easily from your watch and your model is classified as a 50-meter (or higher) water resistant model and has been properly maintained, you may wash the bracelet without removing it. If your timepiece is classified as less than 50-meter water resistant, or is not a water resistant model, we suggest you take your watch to your local jeweler or send it to the nearest Authorized Citizen Service Center for professional cleaning of the exterior."

Using a LED light, cure for 30 seconds, or use a UV light to cure for 1 minute. Using gel polish color of your choice, apply a thin layer from cuticle to free edge. Be sure to cap the tips of the nail to ensure complete coverage. Cure for 60 seconds with an LED light or 2 minutes with a UV Light. Perform steps 3-4 again for each nail, and each nail should have 2 layers of gel polish. Apply a thin layer of Tack Free Gel from cuticle to free edge, and remember to cap the tips. Cure for 60 seconds with a LED light or 2 minutes with a UV Light. Then, apply Cuticle oil to the skin surrounding the nail to have a complete, nourished, and calcium-enriched gel polish manicure."

The wipes are used as necessary, some take them for travel and some use them in the comfort of their home."

First, open the brush cap and remove the rubber band from around the bristles, then slide the sleeve back up over the bristles and put the cap back on. Next, bang the top of the brush on a hard surface, such as a tabletop 6-8 times. You'll want the brush sitting vertical (brush bristles facing down with the cap on) on the tabletop with the cap hitting the table. You'll want to use quite a bit of force when doing so (enough force to help release some of the air pressure in the brush's filter, so don't go easy on it). Once you perform this tapping method, remove the brush cap, slide back the sleeve and run your finger through the bristles so they bend and flick upwards. You should see a \"poof\" of powder. Once you see this, the brush is fully activated. If you don't see this, try repeating the steps by putting more force in it this time. The hard force is really the key in activating the brush as it allows for the powder to push through the filter."

Another key difference is that the Commuter is equipped with tires whereas the Pace 500 model offers butyl rubber tubes. The level 2 is more equipped and offers better features compared to the Pace 500 model. I personally love the on-demand Throttle feature that it comes with, you can use this feature to throttle from a dead stop upto 20MPH! Hope this helps! :)"

We also highly recommend that you consult your child's physician before your child uses a weighted blanket. When used correctly, weighted blankets are considered safe for most children, as long as the blanket is an appropriate size and weight.\n\nWhen choosing or considering a weighted blanket for a child, it is generally best to look for one that is 10% of their body weight. For example, if your child weighs 100 pounds, a 10-pound weighted blanket would be most appropriate. Additionally, do not puncture the weighted insert. If the insert with glass beads becomes torn or damaged, dispose of it immediately as it might become a choking hazard."

Additionally, when comparing the same item on different monitors or at different angles on those monitors, they will appear to be different colors.

These results showed that eating a Fast Bar doesn't interfere with key physiological markers of fasting.  The study also showed that Fast Bar gave people a feeling of being fuller and curbed the desire to eat for up to 3 hours after consumption. In other words, you can eat a Fast Bar to help make fasting easier and more pleasant, and maintain similar ketone and blood glucose levels as a water-only fast."

Here are some of our best practice tips for needle use.\n\n- Ensure that your needle is as finger-tightened as possible before inserting it into the cork.\n- Be sure that the needle guide is sitting right on top of the cork.\n- While you're pouring, be sure to use both hands the entire time - one hand to hold the bottle, and the other to hold the handle of the Coravin. If you only hold the bottle but not the Coravin handle, the needle will not be supported and this may cause it to bend\n- During extraction, ensure that you're pulling the needle out perfectly straight (hold the clamps to the bottle with one hand and carefully pull up on the handle with the other)\n- Daily rinse the spout and needle under a stream of hot tap water, remove from the water, and do a quick press and release of the trigger to clean and maintain your Coravin\n- You'll know it's time to replace the needle when the black non-stick coating starts to wear off and the shiny steel of the needle becomes visible - after at least 300 uses\n\nThis video may help as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2vaEFqYdY"

The Oral-B DTC store does not ship to these states.\nAre you using a payment method that we accept in the store? \n\nIs the Billing Name and Address you entered on your order the same as it appears on your credit card statement? Sometimes even a minor difference will make the credit card company decline our pre-authorization and so we have to cancel the order. \n\nIs it possible the card has been reported as missing or stolen in recent days, or has it been turned off for new authorizations? Lately, some credit cards have a new feature that allows the consumer to turn off the card from new authorizations. If you think there may be the possibility anything like this might have happened, I would suggest calling your credit card company just to make sure they know you want to use the card and that they see it is in good standing. \n\nDo you have enough credit limit on your card to cover the order? If you are using a debit card for the order, you still need to have enough in the checking account tied to that card for the order to be approved. \n\nIf this doesn't help, we completely apologize and regret the loss, but you may purchase your brush heads through other retailers."

We use advanced screening software to detect orders that are fraudulent or have a high chargeback risk. The software analyzes a wide range of information pertaining to your order and if the conditions under which the order is placed are considered high risk it will be rejected. Also, orders that are placed using proxy server or VPN have a high risk for rejection as well. As the system is completely automated and we are currently unable to override, you could try using a different form of payment, different contact and/or shipping information. We also recommend trying to place your order at the Peak Design Amazon Store here: https://www.amazon.com/peakdesign or at a retailer near you: https://www.peakdesign.com/pages/storelocator"
