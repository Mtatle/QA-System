If you signed up after that date, you will not be sent an automated email. This is something we're working on fixing, but for now, if you sign up late, please just send an email to hello@gathre.com and we will get you a code! If you did sign up before the 1st and for some reason haven't gotten your code, please reach out so we can help. \n\nThe birthday gift is good for $25 off of an order of $50 or more and cannot be extended outside of the month it was issued."

Thin coats help prevent bubbling!\n- Wait 5-10 minutes in between coats for the polish to adhere.\n- Seal with Super Glossy Top Coat and reapply it every 2-3 days to keep your mani fresh!"

The bronze color is achieved using iron oxides, which are mineral pigments. These mineral pigments sit on top of skin providing temporary color rather than absorbing into the skin. Although the current formulation offers improved transfer resistance from our original formula, it is not transfer-proof. To minimize color transfer, apply in thin layers, waiting 1-2 minutes to dry between layers. Take care when in contact with delicate or light colored fabrics. Wash immediately with warm water and gentle detergent if color has transferred. We hope this helps.  \n\nIf you would like to initiate a return, please reach out to our Concierge team at concierge@colorescience.com."

Level.2 tires are not intended for riding in snow or during snow fall.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is, if weather impacts your visibility and has the possibility to affect your bike's functionality, it is likely not a safe riding condition."

Don't paddle anywhere that you can't swim back to shore from easily, and don't paddle in cold water, especially without protective gear. \n\nOur float bags are a good companion that help by displacing water that would otherwise fill a compromised kayak. Water is heavy and it's much harder to try to flip a kayak filled with water and the Oru can easily get bent out of shape in that situation. Float bags for a kayak are similar to a PFD for you. However, good paddling conditions for your kayak and practice will keep you safe. We have had customers try self rescue in controlled environments however body dimensions such as height and weight are a key factor."

      "content": "I apologize that you have encountered this issue. We have had some feedback from other customers that reflected similar circumstances. What we have found is that this issue primarily happens with the first access to your bottle. On your first access it will take several short bursts of the trigger to get the wine to pour. This is because there is very little room in the bottle for the gas to go. After a couple of short bursts, hold the trigger for about 1/2 - 1 second to complete the first pour. After your first pour, you can then pour using a couple of short, (1/2-1 second) presses to obtain your pour. \n\nHowever, please note - it does take a bit of time; the system is designed to deliver a 4-5 ounce pour in about 20-25 seconds. You may note that if you use more bursts that wine pours a bit faster, however that generally causes a waste of the gas which you'll observe through a long venting of gas into the air when the bottle is returned to the upright position after pouring. This is just gas that had no place to go in the bottle as it did not replace wine - so it empties into the air. I hope this helps!"

Because the plies in bias-ply tires run from sidewall to sidewall, the sidewall is very stiff, and any flexing of the sidewall is reflected in the tires' footprint. Bias-ply tires can also overheat more easily due to the layers of rubber plies, whereas the steel belts in radial tires help to dissipate heat better."

This is a function of the quality and cost of ingredients and our commitment to doing things our way and to controlling the process, every step of the way. We use better quality ingredients across the board, and we use more of those ingredients, from vanilla to chocolate, etc. Add to this the fact that our product has virtually no air in it (it's called overrun) - less than 10%, versus our closest competitors, whose products contain 40%+ air. But here's the thing: our customers end up getting what they pay for and to us, that's what really matters.\n\nUnfortunately, we also do not set the price in grocery stores. Our retailers are in control of that, and while we do work with them to manage pricing, if their desire is to set a certain margin on our products, we simply cannot control that. McConnell's is a truly made from scratch product - the only one in the freezer aisle that we're aware of. This is significant because it makes for the finest product in the business. And while it may cost a bit more, we think it's worth it. And we hope you ultimately feel the same way."

They are cold processed and require over 30 days to cure. These are made with softer oils (avocado, coconut, castor, etc.) and tend to have a stronger fragrance as a result. These are the cool, swirly-colored soaps you'll see in our ads.\n\nOn the other hand, our milled soaps are machine-made using a milling machine and are free of color. They're comprised of harder oils and a glycerin base, so they're longer-lasting than our handmade, but they do tend to be a bit less fragrant.\n\nThere's actually a blog post on this that goes into a little more depth; if you're interested, you can find it here: https://liveoutlaw.com/blogs/no-stinkin-outlaws/whats-the-difference-between-milled-soap-and-handmade-soap?_pos=5&_sid=092479a65&_ss=r"

      "content": "Most of our fish is wild-caught, although the Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and catfish are farmed species. If you're someone who is a totally wild-caught fish eater, you may want to try our Wild Ocean Blend or CTS Endurance Pack, any of the Paleo listings, or order the coho salmon, sablefish, and other wild-caught species that we feature. I know you might have heard conflicting things about farm-raised fish, and hopefully we can offer some insight on this. There are 5 of us on the management team and we've spent our careers in seafood. All of us \"grew up\" in the wild-caught seafood trade, and as time has gone on we have all developed working knowledge in aquaculture as well. The truth is that farm-raised fish varies widely depending on species and practices, and most importantly, whether wild or farmed, you'll find that \"good fish is good and bad fish is bad.\" This is to say that the best-quality fish nowadays tastes great and is raised or caught and handled properly, and the poorest fish is usually what you would expect it to be: poorly handled, often has water-added, and is usually the cheapest stuff you can buy. If you're concerned about environmental responsibility, then it's worth considering where we as humans are in terms of sourcing food globally. We now farm nearly all the plants and land animals that we consume. With a population of 7 billion, we literally would starve without global plant and animal farming. One population article in National Geographic recently noted that if humans were to turn to hunting for animal protein, we would consume all the wild land animals on Earth within a few weeks. Consider that fact for a moment - almost all the land-based food we eat is raised rather than wild-harvested - because it makes environmental sense. Nowadays we farm about half the seafood consumed globally. Aquaculture was developed in part to avoid \"fishing to the last fish\" - a healthy, tasty way to help supply seafood and take pressure off over-fished resources, and we can attest that the top natural foods grocers today are sourcing farmed fish from suppliers who use no antibiotics, no farm chemicals or pesticides and are in fact environmentally-friendly. Production standards have been developed and are being continuously refined to insure that the environmental and social effect of farming fish is a net positive. So if you shop at the top-end/natural retailers or seek out top fish purveyors, you'll find the best-handled fish available whether it's wild or farmed. If you shop for seafood in big-box discount chains, you'll get what you pay for. As fish guys, we're seeing the differences between these 2 groups getting wider, too, as time goes on. Our mission is to offer direct delivery of top quality seafood. We offer this both to health & fitness-seekers, so that they get the benefits of omega 3 fats in the form of healthy, pure, delicious fish servings, and also to folks who just love great seafood!"

The S1 is 70 lbs with the battery installed. The ZX is 63 lbs with the battery installed. The S2 is 73 lbs with the battery installed. The R is 80 lbs with the battery installed. And the RX is 84 lbs with the battery installed. If selecting a Rack that secures the bike by the tires, make sure the rack can fit the width of the tires: S1 and Z1 have a tire width of 4.25 inches; ZX has a tire width of 4.5 inches; and R/RX and S2 have a tire width of 5.00 inches.

Using your Coravin cleaning tool poke through the eye of the needle to remove any cork. Then slide the tool into the top of the needle and slide down. This action should push any excess cork towards the opening near the needle eye. Poke the tool through the eye of the needle again to remove any last cork particles. Remove the clip from the needle. Hold the cleaned needle by the needle grip, then tilt and slide it back into the needle guide. Securely screw the needle grip back into the Coravin.\n\nThis video may help as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2vaEFqYdY"

Built to take on the concrete jungle, with a modernized big block tread design, this tire is ready to dodge and weave through back alleys, green belts, and traffic-laden streets to deliver you to your final destination with confidence and style. On the other hand, the GRZLY offers a tread for those seeking to venture beyond the paved path. With an aggressive knobby tread pattern, the GRZLY offers excellent grip on a variety of terrain, designed to dig into loose dirt and gravel with ferocity or provide consistent contact and grip on hardpack, rock, and asphalt. Also worth noting that riding the GRZLY on paved roads, the biggest difference will be how loud the tires are compared to the BDGR since the GRZLY is designed to grip loose dirt, just like off road tires are louder than street tires on a vehicle."

The stress could be from sun exposure, a water shortage, or cold temperatures.

Because the liquid dyes come with a dropper, they're extremely easy to measure and blend very quickly with the wax. You simply count the number of drops you use per pound, and make note of the amount, this ensures you get a consistent color with every batch you make. The dye blocks are also very easy to use. Depending on the size batch you're making, you may add one full block or a partial block to achieve the desired color. With each type, you're able to vary the shade by using more or less dye, or you can also blend different dyes to create unique or unusual colors."

Importantly, the amount of sugar in a serving of OLLY gummies (2 to 4 grams) represents a fraction of the average total daily sugar intake by most Americans (80 grams). It's roughly equivalent to eating about 5-10 raisins or drinking an eighth of a cup of apple juice. The real advantage of gummies is that people actually enjoy taking them - so they do. If supplements don't get eaten because the experience is unpleasant, then they're not very effective supplements. We chose not to use artificial \"sugar-free\" sweeteners because they have been linked to health issues and we wanted to stick with only natural sweeteners, colors and flavors."

Stretching will not reverse, but you can prune and repot succulents to get them back into a tidy, compact form."

The difference in the mattresses comes down to what type of cover is best for your family. The 3 mattress options are the Essential, Original, and Waterproof Crib Mattress. \n\nThe Essential is a slimmer profile at only 4\" thick instead of 5.5\" that you find in the Original and Waterproof versions. The covers vary in each type of mattress, so the Essential one has a thinner single layer of spacer material that covers the Wovenaire core, the Original, however, is made with 2-layers of thick spacer material that is quilted together to create soft pillows of air over the fully breathable Wovenaire core, and our Waterproof Mattress uses the same construction in the cover as our Original one, plus a layer of breathable waterproof lining added to one side of the cover. This toddler side helps combat bigger messes as your baby grows and potty training begins! Each mattress cover fully zips off, and the entire mattress is washable from cover to the core. The Essential is a bit firmer in feel, as the cover isn't as thick or quilted as the other 2 which are 2-stage mattresses: firm enough for babies, and comfortable to grow with them all through toddler years."
