These ribbons serve as a reminder to pilots to remove specific parts or components before take off. \n\nThese warnings are of extreme importance; in some cases, non-removal of a labeled part has caused airplane crashes. As our iconic flight jackets became popular with our civilian customers, the \"Remove Before Flight\" ribbon was implemented as a way to pay homage to our aviation roots."

Once the ottoman connector is tightened onto the top of the ottoman leg, you then bring the ottoman to the sofa at an angle (the part of the ottoman facing a bit downwards) so that when you straighten it out, the \"hook\" part of the connector latches onto the front rail of the sofa. You need to really reach under to connect and squeeze the ottoman and sofa rail very closely. Unfortunately I understand connecting it is a little difficult since the connector was made to be pretty tight. It's supposed to fit quite exactly to make sure that the connector stays on tight.  We also recently added a drawing to our instruction manual that might help: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0089/4487/7630/files/Sabai_InstructionManual_Ottoman_Connector-9-9-21.pdf?v=1631211833 If coming at an angle doesn't work we can send a new one, although it would be the same as the one you have. We're also having our designer look into this issue and he is currently in the process of making revisions/redesigning our ottoman connector. When we have this new revision we'd be happy to send it! Just please follow up with us in a month to see what the status is."

That's another reason why we offer all our customers an extended money-back window.

Also, it's best to not clean your delicate lenses with coarse materials (e.g., wool, paper towels, bath towels, t-shirts, etc.). Although they may seem soft, they can scratch your lenses. Lastly, do not lay your eye wear lens-down; this is one of the common ways that lenses end up scratched. They should be stowed away in their case whenever you are not wearing them."

The bag is then hung above the patient's head. IV therapy bags are designed to let gravity, as opposed to a syringe or other forced technique, carry fluid into the veins over time.\n\nThe duration of a single treatment varies from person to person, but typically lasts 30 - 45 minutes. The exceptions to this timeframe are our NAD IV treatments, which generally last 1 - 2 hours per session."

Our favorite bikini-washing formula is combining cold water with just a touch of gentle laundry detergent. Let it soak for 5-10 minutes then rinse it out gently and lay flat to dry. Even on white swimwear, stay away from bleach. For spot cleaning, a little bit of Shout will do the trick. \n\nIf you're drying your swimsuits outside, hang or lay them in the shade. Drying in the sun too long can cause discoloring and fading. Never iron or throw your suits in the dryer. Too much heat can cause fading as well or terrible damage to the fabric."

However since you remove the cork to use it, the Pivot also works on synthetic and composite corks bottles. Perfect for casual consumption. \n \nOur Timeless systems allow the preservation of bottles of wine for much longer. You can pour your favorite still wines without pulling the cork. You just need to place the Timeless System on top of the bottle and push the needle through the cork. Bottles sealed Natural Cork will last the natural shelf life of that Wine, up to months and years later. Hope this helps!"

Our jewelry doesn't have nickel and is hypoallergenic, but sometimes the copper can cause the skin to temporarily discolor."

Both are capable of engraving applications such as wood, glass, leather, and acrylic. The mid-range and high power however have better cutting capabilities. Fiber markers ,on the other hand, are designed for metal materials and hard plastics. Fiber markers are more powerful and engrave quicker than desktop and cabinet lasers by concentrating the laser beam into a thinner point."

This will help clean any urine that may have missed its mark, as both male and female dogs may pee too close to the side or splash. Make sure to get under the tray too! If it is the grass that is smelling, you can also try soaking it in the solutions above then rinse and dry completely. If soaking in bleach do not go over 5 minutes and make sure the ratio of water is greater than bleach. We also recommend using our very own Turftastic to eliminate all urine odor from the synthetic grass or live grass: https://porchpotty.com/products/turftastic-the-first-odor-eliminator-for-dog-potties?_pos=1&_psq=Turftastic&_ss=e&_v=1.0"

      "content": "With a long, tubular shape and blunt tip, a honing steel-also called sharpening steel or honing rod-is designed to realign the edge of your knife's blade with just a few strokes.\n\nHow is this process different from sharpening? The difference is, quite literally, microscopic: as you use your knife, the sharpened part of the blade-i.e. the edge-develops tiny (as in, too small to see with the naked eye) dents, dings, and other defects. With sharpening, you're literally creating a new edge by shaving away incredibly thin layers of metal; with honing, you're simply pushing the existing edge back into alignment, which can make your blade feel temporarily sharper. You can read more on the differences between honing and sharpening in our guide: https://madeincookware.com/blogs/honing-vs-sharpening"

It also comes in more color variances if you'd like something more vibrant or subtle!\n\nThe Level is our classic commuter bike. Though it's heavier than Soltera, it is designed to let you ride faster. If a higher top speed is of utmost importance to you, the Level can reach top speeds of 28 MPH on pedal assist. A rear rack and fenders are also included with the Level in the event you'll be needing these accessories!"

If you have Lume-X, Dive Mode can be accessed through Mission Control. If not, you can manually turn on Dive Mode: with the Lume Cube facing away from you, hold down both buttons until the red charging light blinks. To disable Dive Mode, tap the combination LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT and try cycling through brightness levels by tapping the left button. This can take a few tries to get the timing right.\n\nThis mode has been added fairly recently and has not been added to the guides as we have such a small percentage of customers that use these lights for diving below 60ft."

You can put rolled up terry cloth towels in the pockets to help absorb the moisture from the corners and speed drying. When washing a changing pad you'll need to ensure that all the water is removed before air drying. We suggest putting the washed changing pad on a dry towel and rolling it up tightly to squeeze out the excess water (repeat until all water is removed). We also recommend spot treatment before washing as that'll help loosen up the stains before a regular wash, sometimes even soaking the bag over night in one of these treatments. We've heard things on Motsenbocker Lift Off, Magic Eraser, Boogie Wipes, Shout Wipes, or a paste of Oxy Clean, Dawn dish soap, baking soda works great depending on what the marks are."

This provides natural analgesia in the body without the need to ingest medication or undergo manual manipulation or surgery.\n\nTENS therapy machines can help relieve pain associated with chronic and acute conditions such as headaches, migraines, neck pain, shoulder pain, back pain, sciatica, leg pain, lower limb pain, foot and ankle pain, poor circulation, fibromyalgia, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica, athletic or exercise injuries and more."

In 90% of cases similar to yours, the gas is either leaking or being wasted from one of several known places. The First could be that the capsule cup itself is leaking. We recommend cleaning the threads inside the capsule cup and where it attaches, as sticky residue can build up there, preventing a thorough seal. This can be done with a hot, wet cloth (preferably lint-free, like a bar towel). You also can use a toothbrush and hot water. Allow the threads to dry before reattaching.\n\nThe Second main thing to check on is the gas used per pour, as it's possible that excess gas is escaping after the pour. When pouring your glass of wine, please make sure to only press the trigger lightly 2-3 times to get the flow going. At the end of your pour, when you straighten your Coravin upright, if you hear a long hiss of gas escaping this is indicative of having used too much Argon.  \n\nOther tips to help, please do not unscrew the device to check on the capsule as this will waste all remaining Argon.  Also please remove the cork at the end of the bottle and simply pour wine as regular. Please let me know if any of these tips help solve your issue! If not we would be happy to continue troubleshooting what is wrong with your device, and even replace it if need be. We would also be happy to send you some extra capsules to replace those you lost to this issue."

Due to the limitations of the Pro device in treating such intricate areas, the Precision laser might be a more suitable option.\n\nThe NIRA Precision laser, designed for smaller and more delicate treatment areas, could be easier to maneuver and apply accurately on areas like the nasolabial folds, marionette lines, corners of the mouth, lipstick lines, and laugh lines. Its design allows for precise targeting, which is particularly important when dealing with sensitive or detailed regions."

After this time, remove and discard one cup of water from the bag and replace it with one cup of pond water. Repeat this process three more times at five minute intervals. You can then release the fish into the pond, however you should not dump the water from the bag into your pond.\n\nIn addition, if you are not sure the dealer where you purchased your fish employs preventive steps to insure healthy fish, you may want to do a salt dip for 15 seconds using 1 pound of pond salt per gallon of water in a separate container prior to releasing the fish. Do not use iodized salt."

Please be aware that some dripping is perfectly normal as it does take a few minutes for the cork to reseal after the needle has been extracted. A few drops is nothing to be worried about, but it keeps leaking from the needle hole hours later then please review this list of other possible scenarios:\n- Ensure you're accessing wines with natural cork. While you can access wines that use -synthetic closures those closures don't reseal and there'll be leakage.\n- Sometimes, wine can pool underneath the foil and appear to be dripping or leaking - again, to determine if this is the issue, you can remove the foil to check. This happens most frequently on a first access.\n- Temperature affects how a wine reseals. Corks at cooler temperatures take longer to reseal.\n- How long did you leave your Coravin in the cork? We don't recommend leaving the needle engaged in the cork for long periods of time, as it can make it more difficult for the cork to reseal.\n- Sometimes a cork in poor condition (either due to age, manufacturing, or storage) will have difficulty resealing in general.\n\nHopefully these tips will help and you might find this video helpful as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m75eTiVsLHg"

Again, since we do not print on vinyl like a lot of other removable wallpaper companies, the wallpaper looks and feels like real wallpaper and not plastic. I hope this helps!"

Otherwise, it may break from the added tension. You could also use a set starting with .007\", such as our item #1346 Dunlop Reverend Willy's Electric Guitar Strings: https://www.stewmac.com/strings-and-accessories/strings/electric-guitar-strings/dunlop-reverend-willys-electric-guitar-strings/"

The most powerful super greens include: \n• Broccoli \n• Kale \n• Spinach \n• Parsley \n• Barley grass and wheat grass.\n\nIn contrast, super reds contain many unique phytonutrients due to their color, such as lycopene and anthocyanins.

If you're lucky enough to catch fish yourself and enjoy cooking and eating your catch, or if you live near fishing communities and can buy seafood fresh off the boat, then you know what we're talking about. A few days after fish is caught and filleted, it begins to lose its freshness, bacteria start to do their work, and flavor gradually changes. After 2 weeks, virtually all \"fresh\" unfrozen fish will no longer be fit to eat. Luckily, fish that is flash-frozen stops the breakdown process. You can then keep this fish in a very fresh state for months, thawing and cooking it when you want to enjoy fish the way it tastes when it comes out of the water. The \"fresh\" fish that you see in the big-box discount grocery store in your neighborhood is usually either already a week or more old, or previously frozen. The exceptions to this are the natural/high-end grocers and fish markets who carefully source their fish. This is where we come in. We're in the sourcing and processing business - many of those natural/high end retailers are our customers - and in order to offer you a variety of the best fish in a state of freshest flavor, our fish is frozen as soon as possible after processing. In this case, the fish industry's inside quote rings true: Our frozen fish is usually fresher than fresh! It's what we feed our families, and we believe it's what you'll want to eat once you've tried it."

Allow yourself to savor the caviar without chewing to extract the luxurious buttery flavor from the pearls."

Click \"Redeem\":\nAfter choosing your points, click the Redeem button. This will generate a unique discount code just for you.\n6. Use the Code at Checkout:\nAt checkout, paste your code into the box that says \"Discount code or gift card\", then click Apply.\nHelpful Tip:\nIf you ever lose track of your code, no worries! Just go back to the Redeemed tab in the Redeem Rewards section to view it again.\nPoints expire 12 months after they are earned, but don't worry - we'll send you a reminder ahead of time so you'll have the chance to use them before they expire.\nIf you run into any trouble at all, don't hesitate to reach back out, we're always happy to help!"

There's a secure shelf-like seat where your baby sits, while you hold them with an arm. This seat is designed to put your baby's hips in the recommended M-shaped position while taking the strain off of your back, arms, and hips. It's also designed to store items like diapers, wipes, and other essentials inside."

To maintain these standards, it's critical that every ingredient in our ice creams be of the highest\nquality. While we're ardent supporters of organics in general, in our almost 70 years as a dairy, it's been our experience that milk & cream can vary greatly in quality and consistency. Inconsistency in milk & cream can be traced to any number of factors, including animal husbandry, pasture type and processing. The milk & cream we use comes from cows raised by local dairy co-ops on the Central\nCoast. It's grass-grazed, hormone and antibiotic free, and of exceptionally high quality. It's important to know that organic is a term that defines a process, rather than objective quality. There's wonderful and not-so-wonderful organic milk in the market, just as there's wonderful and not-so-wonderful organic fruit, nuts, chocolate, etc. \n\nWhile organic is certainly an important factor when it comes to selecting ingredients for McConnell's Fine Ice Creams, committing wholly to organics - over objective quality - would mean McConnell's valued a specific process over making the finest product we can make and this is unacceptable to us. I hope this informaiton was helpful!"

The stainless steel band may contain a small amount of nickel, but testing has shown that the amount is below the safety thresholds set by international regulating bodies. If you have concerns about nickel sensitivity, we have the following bands in nylon or vegan leather. You can check out all available accessories here: https://embr.attn.tv/sl/es28OMRk\n \nThe Wave 1 uses a standard 22mm watch pin, and the Wave 2 uses an 18mm watch pin, so they're both compatible with most styles of watch bands if you'd like to purchase something on your own.\n \nThe back of the Wave 2 is made of medical-grade polycarbonate (polycarbonate is a type of plastic that's known for being particularly strong). This part of the Wave is made of plastic to help insulate the skin from the metal heat sink, while still being comfortable against the skin. In the Wave 2, the plastic backing is built to be tougher than ever: it's thicker, more durable, and fully integrated into the round design without any protruding edges."

Running on a 220-volt outlet, a Level 2 charger can deliver between 12 and 80 miles of charge per hour - meaning you can generally get a full charge overnight. Level 3 chargers, or DC fast chargers, are used to get a rapid charge when you're taking a trip.

Please go to the 2:00 minute mark of this video and our team member Trevor describes this process in depth! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFEIpcZFFws&t=70s \n\nThe charging order should look like this Laptop > Adapter > Cable > Panel \n\nWhat some customers do not realize is that there is a polarity to the cable, i.e., that the longer cable must go into the light, not the shorter one. The shorter cable goes into your power source. Lastly, I also recommend charging your light with an apple phone brick through a wall outlet with the included cable. Keep me posted on your light."

Because it uses a pressure pump to push the water through the reverse osmosis membrane (cost for electricity is negligible), it wastes far less than the standard RO system: Only ⅕ of the input water goes down the drain (80% recovery rate), compared to 3-5 gallons that other RO systems waste per 1 gallon of filtered water produced.

Avoid submerging for extended periods as this can also cause rust due to prolonged exposure to moisture. Once the food has been released from the surface, you can clean with mild dish soap, and a non-abrasive sponge, then dry immediately.\n\nYou can watch our video here: youtube.com/watch?v=3UWAiW6SaoU&feature=youtu.be"

The difference between the different grades of matcha is the quality of the leaves used to make them. Younger tea leaves at the top of plants that are picked earlier in harvest are the most prized leaves for matcha.\n\nBecause they are younger, they contain less stems and veins. This makes them ideal for grinding into a very fine powder, and gives the matcha a sweeter and more delicate flavor. These are the leaves that are used in our highest grade of matcha, Ceremonial Matcha.\n\nAs you move down the body of the plant the leaves are bigger and more mature. Leaves that are more mature will have more stems and veins, making the matcha less fine. Tencha leaves are deveined by hand in the process of making matcha. Because the more mature leaves are more veiny, it is harder to separate every single stem and vein from the leaf. This can make the matcha more coarse.\n\nThe best of these leaves are used to make our Ceremonial and Premium Matcha, and the leaves not chosen are used to make our Culinary Matcha."

Soft succulents, such as Echeveria and Crassula, tend to have more consistent color year-round but are influenced by the amount of direct sun they receive.

The very bottom rim of your Solo Stove is actually the coolest part of the unit, so a little insulation between your Solo and the surface it will rest on goes a long way. You can find more information on that here : https://blog.solostove.com/when-to-use-a-fire-pit-stand/ We also offer a spark arresting shield for extra protection against popping embers that might find their way in places they don't belong."

Light to moderate raindrops or splashes from a wet road will not harm your ebike, but be weary of harsher weather and rainfall conditions. Level tires are not intended for riding in snow or during snow fall.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is, if weather impacts your visibility and has the possibility to affect your bike's functionality, it is likely not a safe riding condition."

You should hear a soft snap or click as the locking mechanism of each leg engages\n- Attach all four rubber feet to the bottom of each leg\n- Place the custom sheet on the pad.\n- Ensure that all fabric on the Travel Crib legs is pulled down into correct position and not bunched up or pulled up on leg (as this will pull up the corners of the base)\n\nThe Newton Travel Crib and Play Yard is anything but traditional, and you can expect some details to be different than you might be used to with other travel cribs. Because the sleeping pad is not attached to a rigid base, you may not see the same type of fit that you might see with a traditional travel crib. With Newton, every component has been designed and constructed to be as breathable as possible. From the sheet, through the sleeping pad and cover, all the way to the side walls of the travel crib itself - all of these fabrics are fully breathe-thru. This means that if there is an unintended bump in the fabric, you can rest easy knowing that there is no safety concern with the fully breathable mattress in the Newton Travel Crib."

Also, many cities provide bulk recycling pick-up, as long as your bulky items are wrapped in a plastic furniture bag. All New York City customers can leave their old mattresses out on the curb with the rest of their recycling and the city will take care of it. If you are located elsewhere, we suggest calling your local authorities to see if they have a similar program in place.\n\nIf neither of those options are viable, 1-800-GOT-JUNK? can do the leg work. While this option isn't free, they will pick up the mattress (and box spring if you're also parting with that), do everything they can to get the mattress repurposed, or otherwise dispose of it safely."

When you grow coffee at a higher altitude it slows the development and ripening of the beans. This is because the temperature of the environment is cooler which causes the beans to develop more slowly. The slow growth of the beans allows them to absorb more nutrients and become much more dense and harder than grow coffee at lower elevations. This means that there are more antioxidants in the beans and that you will get more out of the coffee you are drinking."
