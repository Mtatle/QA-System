Made with a proprietary blend of whey and collagen proteins, It's designed to offer a different eating experience, catering to those who prefer a softer, less dense texture. Like the BUILT Bars, BUILT Puffs are also high in protein and coated in chocolate, providing a guilt-free treat that satisfies sweet cravings without compromising nutritional goals."

That's because your hybrid car's gasoline engine will still need regular oil changes, service for its heating and air conditioning system, cabin air filter replacements, and more. Thanks to regenerative braking, a hybrid car's brakes should last longer than on a gasoline car. However, due to the increased weight of the battery and motor, hybrid cars may need tire changes more frequently."

Be sure to dispense half a pump to the applicator tip and dot around both eyes. This half pump is enough to cover the entire orbital region (under eye to brow-including eyelids) for both eyes. This means ¼ pump per eye. If you apply more than this, the extra product can collect in fine lines or settle in under-eye creases. If you are using it only for under the eye, as opposed to the entire eye area, you may require less product. Once the appropriate amount is applied, use the applicator tip to smooth the product over and then use your fingertips to blend- this will allow for a nice finish.\n\nIf you have any further concerns or would like to submit a return/exchange, please reach out to our Concierge team at concierge@colorescience.com."

The illumination density gets relatively weaker over time compared to the first 6 months."

We'll issue your store credit for the returned items. \n\nWe can offer even exchanges if you want a different size and if the items aren't on clearance, sale, promotion or a custom item. We cannot even exchange for a different color or item; only the same item in a different size. Please call our Customer Service to establish if we have the item in stock. They'll confirm by texting you your even exchange order is ready for pickup. Then when you're ready to pickup, text us and leave the items in a bin with Even Exchange written on the bag and with your packing slip inside with the items. Items have to be returned in original condition and packaging with tags. We'll have a bag outside with Even Exchange on it with your name and the new item for you to pick up."

If any liquid gets above the halfway mark (above the globe liner), it simply drips or drains down to the liner and then into the litter without collecting or pooling anywhere. \n\nThis results in a clump forming at the perimeter of the litter bed, which is removed by the peeling action of the globe liner during a clean cycle. Constant spraying will require that you clean the interior of the globe more frequently to remove any residue, and, for deep cleaning, you can disassemble the globe into two halves (top and bottom)."

The sunlight is partially filtered and indirect  through a window. Although the charging indicator may turn on, the light will not be charging efficiently indoors.

Many popular \"zero calorie\" drinks use artificial sweeteners to obtain that claim. The health risks of artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame are becoming increasingly well-known. That's why we promise that they'll never be included in any of our products. Instead, we use natural, zero-calorie Stevia as part of our sweetener blend. Many consumers find the taste of Stevia on its own to be unpleasant, which is why we blend Stevia with raw organic blue agave. With that combination, you could say that we hit the low-calorie, low-glycemic \"sweet spot.\" As an added plus, the agave provides a source of energy and it doesn't cause your insulin levels to spike like other sweeteners such as high-fructose corn syrup."

Key ingredients like niacinamide help to restore intimate skin with daily use, while coconut oil and safflower oil help to provide hydration and moisture. If you are feeling dry, but not necessarily feeling pain, sensitivity to touch, or burning, the lotion is a great choice for you. This lotion formulation is slightly thicker than the V Relief Serum, and can be used daily for maintaining a healthier, more nourished vulva and vagina. V relief serum is for severe dryness, itching stinging, and burning. If you are experiencing any of the following, V Relief Serum is for you: Your vulva and vagina are sensitive to the touch; You feel pain, burning, itching, or stinging when applying products, wiping, or intimacy; You feel discomfort and severe dryness."

Next I would suggest allowing more time to let the Cell Rejuvenating Priming Moisturizer sink into the skin before moving on to any other make up base product.\n\nIf you still see issues you may also wish to review the type of applicator you are using when applying your base products as these may be contributing to any \"lifting\" of product.

Makgeolli has an opaque white appearance due to the delicate rice sediment remaining in the drink. The sediment greatly enhances the flavor, body and aroma of the drink, so be sure to give Makgeolli a quick stir or shake before consuming!"

Clean the table surface with warm soapy water or a household cleaner before collecting your sample. Make sure to activate your kit barcode (found on the inside top flap of your test kit) before shipping your sample and don't forget to take a picture of your Tracking Label before mailing so that you can track your sample on its way back to us.

Liposomal C is ascorbic acid enclosed in a liposome made from substances that parallel the architecture of the body cells. This allows the vitamin to pass through the digestive system, into our bloodstream for cellular delivery. That means you get more C per capsule. One capsule contains 500 mg of Vitamin C. We suggest a 1000 mg per day but if you're new to Liposomal C, we suggest you start low and go slow. During times where you are exposed to a virus or are sick, we recommend increasing the dosage but spacing it throughout the day."

Since eyeglass frames fit certain face shapes differently, it is important to observe how a frame rests on your unique facial features. For example, if the bridge area does not fit properly on your nose then the glasses will slide down, affecting not only how they look and feel but also how you see. Also, if glasses are too narrow and tight, then they may put pressure on your face while restricting your peripheral vision. Wearing lenses with incorrect alignment specifications will commonly cause issues such as visual discomfort, blurriness, eye strain, \"pulling sensation\" and headaches."

(No need to flip it though!)\n• Cleaning dust particles off of your mattress by vacuuming it once a month.\n• Installing a mattress pad or protector to protect your DreamCloud from spills and other accidental damages."

The volume of gas into the bottle will dictate the volume of wine that pours. This volume is controlled by the person using the device. The longer you hold the trigger the more gas is used. It is more that the amount of gas used per pour will affect how many pours you get from a cartridge. If you want a smaller pour and use less gas to facilitate that pour you will get more pours per cartridge. If you want a larger pour you may receive less.\n\nThis video may help as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shWVQHLliCU"

Deep freezing, like all of KnowSeafood's products, pauses that time, meaning our blast frozen seafood, thawed only when you choose to cook it, delivers the freshest possible product, other than buying it on the dock."

As the warm air cools, it can create a vacuum. If the door is hard to open, wait a few minutes to allow the air pressure to equalize, and then try opening the doors again to see if it opens easier. Inspect the seals (gaskets) around the doors to be certain that they are clean and free of debris. If the seals are dirty or sticky, this will make the doors hard to open. If necessary, clean the seals with warm water and a mild detergent. Be certain to rinse the seals well. Please don't use harsh or abrasive cleaners.\n\nCheck the arrangement of food and other items in your refrigerator so that nothing is interfering with the functionality of the doors. Check the shelves and bins for any items that may stick out too far and rearrange them if necessary.\n\nIt's also normal for the doors to be somewhat difficult to open if your unit is new. It's also important to be sure that the unit is leveled and that the doors are aligned. Kindly refer to your owner's manual for information regarding the leveling of the doors."

Preparing - You'll want to make sure you're avoiding hand washing and showering for at least 30 mins to an hour before you paint\n2. Make sure you are not using a separate base coat, as our polish has a built-in one.\n3. Prep nails with the Nail Polish Remover Pot, and avoid touching your hair, towels, etc so no oil can transfer to your nail bed.\n4. Then, always paint 2 - 3 VERY THIN coats and give each one at least 5 - 10 minutes of dry time before applying another. \n5. Clean up any polish that is on your cuticles, and make sure it is only on the nail itself. That will help prevent any peeling around your cuticles!\n6. Seal with your Top Coat and reapply every 2 - 3 days to really lock in the mani and keep it fresh!"

Numerically higher gear ratios produce more torque, are quicker off the line, and deliver a lower top speed. Conversely, lower numeric gear ratios produce less torque, are slower at launch, and deliver a higher top speed.

They are best suited for cold nutrition shakes, water and sports drinks.  \n\nOur Flex bottles feature our unique Flex Lids which offer two ways to sip. There is an edge drinking hole-similar to a traditional coffee cup as well as the option to sip from a removable straw (included). Both edge drinking hole and straw port can be sealed so there is no need to worry about spills/leaks while on-the-go!  Flex lids do not feature our removable agitator. Our Flex bottles are great for both hot and cold beverages including coffee, water, tea, smoothies and carbonated drinks."

We're still researching how we can make our micro anchor cords skinnier while retaining the same strength, and we’re even considering making custom split rings for this purpose! In the meantime hopefully one of these solutions will work for you."
