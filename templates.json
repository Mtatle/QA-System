If you're taking a shorter trip or are a light packer, a 26\" case may be sufficient. However, if you plan to pack more or are going on a longer trip, a 29\" case may be better suited for your needs. It's also important to consider your mode of transportation and any weight restrictions that may apply. Additionally, some people may find a larger case more cumbersome to handle, so that's something to consider as well. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what you feel will work best for your specific travel needs."

      "shortcut": "",
      "content": "Good question! With so many options, it can be tough to choose. Here's some information about the key differences.\n\nSerums are concentrated moisturizers that are lighter weight than creams or lotions, and their active ingredients are generally more potent. They target a variety of skin concerns (like hyperpigmentation and dark spots) by delivering a large dose of key ingredients. Some serums can be used alone, but most OLAY serums are designed to be worn under another moisturizer. Find out more about our range of OLAY Serums. \n\nLotions have a medium consistency. Many people prefer them for daytime use since they're easily absorbed into the skin. You can use them alone or over a serum. They tend to be good for oily or combination skin. \n\nCreams, the most common type of moisturizer, are richer and thicker than lotions and serums. They easily penetrate skin to deliver key ingredients that lock in moisture. By binding water to the skin and reducing evaporation, creams actually increase skin's water content. Not all cream moisturizers are the same, so it's important to choose based on your skin type. Check out OLAY Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Vitamin C Lightweight Moisturizer, and Retinol 24 Night Moisturizer, a few of our most popular creams.\n\nOLAY Whips are one of our more recent breakthroughs in skin care science, delivering powerful results with a light-as-air finish. Whips are uniquely formulated with Active Rush Technology™ to hold and quickly release 1000x their weight in hydration and active ingredients. Whips transform from cream to liquid on contact, flash absorbing into skin and leaving a smooth, matte finish. They're available with and without SPF in our Regenerist line."

If you use them in a closet or garage where there is more airflow, they will last about 30 days. Pouches unused, sealed in the silver bag, will last for months and months since the bag is air tight.

Less officially, it never hurts to burn some sage to promote bag healing. Following that, we recommend using simple green (or other mild solvent) on the affected areas, then give the bag a warm and soapy bath in dawn or a similar dish-washing liquid.

Women also experience relief from itching, burning, and painful sex. \n\nOn the other hand, the original Revaree has hyaluronic acid sodium salt 5 mg, semi-synthetic glycerides and most women experience relief by 30 days.

For example, within the container waxes we have, some are extremely soft and require only one pour, but there are some that are harder and require a second pour. Within the pillar waxes, you can choose a wax with a more consistent color throughout or one that has a mottled effect.

Other designs are two-piece bucket seats, with a separate bottom and top that allow for a snug fit.\n\nAnything labeled as Ready-Fit is a semi-custom design, so the fit may not be as precise as custom covers.

In the case of vaginal dryness, it works to attract and retain moisture in the cells of the vaginal lining, which helps to create a healing environment for thinning and damaged skin. The hyaluronic molecules in it can absorb up to 1,000 times their own weight in water, which helps regain vaginal elasticity and softness. Additionally, hyaluronic acid has been rigorously studied in multiple clinical trials and is shown to be safe and free of side effects, with no effect on estrogen levels."

Because we love our environment and believe in doing our part, a large percentage of our packaging is made from cornstarch. Our 100% Cornstarch Polybags are biodegradable and will disintegrate over time. Currently, we are in the process of transitioning into having all our shoes packaged in these Eco-friendly Polybags, which is why some of our shoes do not come in boxes. We truly appreciate your support in our decision to be environmentally friendly."

Both laser treatments are simple, fast, and effective for clinical-grade wrinkle reduction in as little as 90 days. They also feature 5 power levels (or comfort levels) that enable you to adjust each laser to compliment your skin sensitivity.\n\nWith a 10x larger treatment tip than NIRA Precision, the NIRA Pro Laser is able to treat the full face, neck, chest, and back of hands in just minutes a day. In addition, our in-house laser experts designed NIRA Pro without a treatment button - enabling treatment to automatically begin once the device tip is in full contact with the skin.

Light to moderate raindrops or splashes from a wet road will not harm your ebike, but be wary of harsher weather and rainfall conditions. Additionally, although Sinch can ride remarkably in snow, that isn't to say it is as safe to ride during active and heavy snowfall.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is, if weather impacts your visibility and has the possibility to affect your bike's functionality, it is likely not a safe riding condition."

This shear is a favorite for working with men's haircuts, especially scissor over comb work.\n\nThe InvisiBlend is anything other than a traditional blender. Its over-polished blunt blade forces the hair over the 23 sharp convex teeth in such a way that no two hairs are cut the same length.

Do not use apple cider, balsamic, or white wine vinegar.\n• You can submerge the full knife, but if the blade is the only part with surface rust, you can just place the rusty blade in it. Leave for 3-5 minutes.\n• You can use a sponge, wire brush, scrubber, steel wool, scrubbing pad, or even a toothbrush to rub the rust off the knife. Be cautious with metal tools that may leave marks on the blade. Finally, wash the knife with soap and water, and then make sure it is thoroughly dried before putting it away."
