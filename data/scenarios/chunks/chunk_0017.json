Could you let me know where you got it and, if possible, share a screenshot? I'll do my best to help from there.",

So text stated get 15 percent off when you give email and phone number.. as many times as I've ordered the product.. never received a discount code. I get having to spend a certain amount to get gifts etc but the very first time I gave the info there was no code -so maybe I don't understand",
