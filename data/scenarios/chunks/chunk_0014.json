If your tracking says the package was delivered but you haven't received it, I recommend checking around your home and with nearby houses, just in case it was dropped off by mistake. Also, check with anyone you live with, like family, roommates, or a landlord, to see if they accepted it for you. Sometimes packages are also held by property managers, an apartment office, or even your local post office. Let me know if you can't find it, I'm here to help!",
