However, the boys' fat heads were a lot larger than the girls because they included the long hair on the girls within that size. If you want all faces the same size (which I would recommend because the size difference was significant) there is an option to trim long hair out of the fat head. It's up to you but just wanted to make note of that. Definitely make sure you are getting a print quality digital image for each senior so that they come out clearly. Hope this helps!",
