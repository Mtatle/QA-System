I only support this company solely based on the quality of the clothing AND the word of Chadd Wright and his 3 of 7 project company relationship/sponsorship by barbell.  He speaks so highly of \"them\" but i am a pee-on who can not tell him nor would he care to hear of one persons documented issues with his #1 sponsor who he speaks so highly of that i am sure he brings a lot of business to the company probably just as much value to the barbell company by the purchase of items by his viewers ( if not more so) than by the amount barbell invest in Chadd and the 3 of 7 project.",
      "AgentMessage1": "Barbell Apparel: Thanks for sharing this, and I genuinely apologize for the inconvenience and frustration you've experienced with us. That's not the kind of experience we aim to provide. Since you've emailed the team, have you checked your spam and promo folders for the response from our team? Our emails end up there sometimes.",
      "customerMessage2": "If you are aware of an email sent back plz send it to my inbox and or text please  because i do not filter or read my spam before deleting them. i do read all of my texts and no response in the matter was ever sent to my text. it is a simple matter and solution that should not be passed off as i didn't check my spam or promo. Barbell had no problem sending me all other correspondence especially the conversation between Sarah and i AND all the \"promos\" including the Elite membership so why woukd the most important correspondence be send and captured as a spam but non of the others?!?  Just resolve this simple matter i have proven that i am a repeat customer who should be valued as such or i do take my documented correspondence to 3of 7 somehow bc i am sure someone there as a fellow Christian would want fairness from a hard working supporter of them and their number one sponsor. Thank you in advance for your appreciation.",
      "AgentMessage2": "Barbell Apparel: I'm truly sorry for the frustration this has caused. I completely understand how important this matter is to you, and I wish I could resolve it directly. Unfortunately, I don't have access to our emails, so I'm unable to retrieve or review the correspondence myself. The best way forward is to reach out to our team via email, as they are fully equipped to handle these concerns and can provide a proper resolution. Thank you for your patience and for being a valued supporter-we genuinely appreciate it.",
      "customerMessage3": "The problem is that this matter is NOT important to \"you\".  I am tired of the hollow \"apologies\" if thats what \"you\" call \"them\".  Everyone knows the old saying that If \"you\" want something done \" you have to do it yourself. So all \"you\" have done is proven how much \"you\" value \" your\" customers.  Listen carefully to your commercials and it is speaking the truth.  \"Your\" company is not for everyone and it definitely is not what Chadd Wright thinks \"you\" are. If i am in the wrong then dont make excuses or lay blame just speak the truth and tell me where i went wrong in this matter.  Otherwise please tell me what to do to resolve this matter. Thank you in advance.",

I've sent another notification to the team and asked them if they can prioritize your concern. I will be sure to text you as soon as they provide an update.",
