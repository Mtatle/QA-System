So the 28mm size is ideal for precision on small cutting jobs - it can cut into inside corners on intricate appliques with better control than a larger blade, and is also ideal for cutting clothing pattern pieces with curved lines like armscyes and notches. \n\nFor the 45mm size, choose that when you have small straight cuts to do, like cutting on the line for half square triangles. It's also the one to choose if you only have one rotary cutter as it does most cutting jobs well. As for the largest 60mm size, it's great for those who have larger hands, and is good for cutting up to six layers of quilting cotton or for long straight cuts like the width of fabric folded.",
