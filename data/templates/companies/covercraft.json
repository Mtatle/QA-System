      "content": "That's a great question! The difference between the UVS100 Original and the UVS100 Premier Series Custom Sunscreens is mainly in the appearance and included accessories, not performance.\n\nBoth are custom-fit to your vehicle's windshield and built with the same core materials: a reflective outer layer, a foam core for insulation, and a soft felt backing. Both provide excellent heat and UV protection and help keep your interior cooler.\n\nThe Premier Series, however, adds a more upscale look. It features a black backing and black binding around the edges, while the Original has a lighter gray color. The Premier also comes in premium finishes like Chrome Camouflage, Galaxy Silver, and white, which give it a more stylish appearance.\n\nIn short, both perform the same in terms of sun and heat protection, but the Premier Series offers a more refined design and added accessories. If aesthetics and presentation matter to you, the Premier is the better option. If you're focused strictly on function, the Original will serve you just as well. Hope this helps!",

PrecisionFit seat covers are snug-fitting and foam-backed, except for the Spacer Mesh material. These cannot be machine-washed due to the foam.\n\nMarathon Excel seat covers are also snug fitting, made from our toughest material, Cordura, and are machine washable.\n\nSeatSaver seat covers provide a great fit, but they are designed to be easily installed and removed for convenient machine washing. \n\nBucket seat covers are typically a one-piece design with pillows that secure in between the seats for added security. Other designs are two-piece bucket seats, with a separate bottom and top that allow for a snug fit.\n\nAnything labeled as Ready-Fit is a semi-custom design, so the fit may not be as precise as custom covers. These designs accommodate a wider range of patterns.",

      "content": "We don't sell waterproof covers, and that's by design. Since 1965, we've been trusted by car owners to protect their vehicles with covers that are carefully engineered for long-term care. One of the biggest lessons we've learned in six decades of craftsmanship is that waterproof materials can do more harm than good. A true waterproof fabric doesn't breathe. That means any moisture, humidity, or gases trapped underneath have nowhere to escape. The result? Rust, corrosion, and even mold-the very problems you're trying to avoid. That's why especially our outdoor car covers are made with water-resistant, breathable fabrics designed to: \n\n• Shed most rainfall and block moisture from seeping in \n• Allow trapped heat and humidity to escape, protecting finishes and metalwork \n• Prevent rust and corrosion, keeping your vehicle safe for the long run \n\nBy balancing water resistance with breathability, we ensure your cover protects without trapping damage underneath. So, while you won't find a \"waterproof\" car cover here, you'll get something better: a cover built with over 60 years of expertise-engineered to safeguard your vehicle the right way.
