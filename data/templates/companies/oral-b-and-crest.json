The Oral-B DTC store does not ship to these states.\nAre you using a payment method that we accept in the store? \n\nIs the Billing Name and Address you entered on your order the same as it appears on your credit card statement? Sometimes even a minor difference will make the credit card company decline our pre-authorization and so we have to cancel the order. \n\nIs it possible the card has been reported as missing or stolen in recent days, or has it been turned off for new authorizations? Lately, some credit cards have a new feature that allows the consumer to turn off the card from new authorizations. If you think there may be the possibility anything like this might have happened, I would suggest calling your credit card company just to make sure they know you want to use the card and that they see it is in good standing. \n\nDo you have enough credit limit on your card to cover the order?
