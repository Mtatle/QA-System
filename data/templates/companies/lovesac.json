Here are some steps to help you get started:\n- Set Seat Cushions on the floor to see if they fit your room in your desired configuration.\n- If you are not placing Sactionals on the carpet, put felt pads (included with Seats and Sides) on all Shoes and Feet so you don't scratch the floor.\n- Each shoe has a crosshair on top to show you where the feet go.\n- U-shaped steel Clamps secure Seats and Sides together.\nYou can watch this video for a full assembly walk through: https://lovesac.attn.tv/afbXZOM_c24S or check out these How-To PDFs: https://lovesac.attn.tv/aLgAzKLtnU5u",
